  The get_artifact function is used to retrieve artifact location between modelable entities defined in the same service template.

  If the artifact is a Docker image, return the image name in the form of
  "registry/repository/name:tag" or "registry/repository/name@sha256:digest"

  If entity_name or artifact_name is not found return ``null``.

  See `get_artifact <https://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.3/os/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.3-os.html#_Toc26969460>`_

get_env
^^^^^^^

  Returns the value of the given environment variable name.
  If NAME is not present in the environment, return the given default value if supplied or return None.

  e.g. {get_env: NAME} or {get_env: [NAME, default]}

  If the value of its argument is empty (e.g. [] or null), return the entire dictionary.

.. _get_input:

get_input
^^^^^^^^^

  The get_input function is used to retrieve the values of properties declared within the inputs section of a TOSCA Service Template.
  See `TOSCA Property Functions <https://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.3/os/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.3-os.html#_Toc26969456>`_

  The get_nodes_of_type function can be used to retrieve a list of all known instances of nodes of the declared Node Type.

.. _get_property:

get_property
^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The get_property function is used to retrieve property values between modelable entities defined in the same service template.
  See `TOSCA Property Functions <https://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.3/os/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.3-os.html#_Toc26969456>`_

  Quote the given value without evaluating it.
  For example:

  .. code-block:: YAML

      q:
        eval:

  Will evaluate to:

  .. code-block:: YAML

    eval:
       this will not be evaluated

  without any further evaluation.

.. _token:

token
^^^^^

  The token function is used on a string to parse out (tokenize) substrings separated by one or more token characters within a larger string.

Semantics
~~~~~~~~~

Each segment specifies a key in a resource or JSON/YAML object.
"::" is used as the segment delimitated to allow for keys that contain "." and "/"

Path expressions evaluations always start with a list of one or more Resources.
and each segment selects the value associated with that key.
If segment has one or more filters
each filter is applied to that value -- each is treated as a predicate
that decides whether value is included or not in the results.
If the filter doesn't include a test the filter tests the existence or non-existence of the expression,
depending on whether the expression is prefixed with a "!".
If the filter includes a test the left side of the test needs to match the right side.
If the right side is not a variable, that string will be coerced to left side's type before comparing it.
If the left-side expression is omitted, the value of the segment's key is used and if that is missing, the current value is used.

If the current value is a list and the key looks like an integer
it will be treated like a zero-based index into the list.
Otherwise the segment is evaluated again all values in the list and resulting value is a list.
If the current value is a dictionary and the key is "*", all values will be selected.

If a segment ends in "?", it will only include the first match.
In other words, "a?::b::c" is a shorthand for "a[b::c]::0::b::c".
This is useful to guarantee the result of evaluating expression is always a single result.

The first segment:
If the first segment is a variable reference the current value is set to that variable's value.
If the key in the first segment is empty (e.g. the expression starts with '::') the current value will be set to the evaluation of '.all'.
If the key in the first segment starts with '.' it is evaluated against the initial "current resource".
Otherwise, the current value is set to the evaluation of ".ancestors?". In other words,
the expression will be the result of evaluating it against the first ancestor of the current resource that it matches.

If key or test needs to be a non-string type or contains a unallowed character use a var reference instead.

When multiple steps resolve to lists the resultant lists are flattened.
However if the final set of matches contain values that are lists those values are not flattened.

For example, given:

.. code-block:: javascript

 {x: [ {
         a: [{c:1}, {c:2}]
       },
       {
         a: [{c:3}, {c:4}]
       }
     ]
 }

``x:a:c`` resolves to:
 ``[1,2,3,4]``
not
 ``[[1,2], [3,4]])``

(Justification: It is inconvenient and fragile to tie data structures to the particular form of a query.
If you want preserve structure (e.g. to know which values are part
of which parent value or resource) use a less deep path and iterate over results.)
