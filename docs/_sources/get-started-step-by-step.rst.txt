===============
Getting Started
===============

Once you've installed `Unfurl`, you are ready to configure it and create your first Unfurl project.

.. tip::
  Before diving in, it is recommended that you read this high-level overview of `How it works`_.

1. Configure your home environment
===================================

Unfurl creates a "home" directory (by default at ``~/.unfurl_home``) that contains the configuration settings and tools that you want shared by all your Unfurl projects. This is a good place to keep an inventory of the various account settings you'll need to connect to your cloud resources. You can group these settings into `contexts` and `Unfurl projects` with inherit them -- making easy for different projects to switch between contexts.

Contexts can also be used to isolate the environment Unfurl runs in, enabling you set different versions of tools, create Python virtual environment or run Unfurl in a Docker container.

Under the hood, Unfurl's home is just a standard `Unfurl` project modeling the local machine it is running on so you can customize it and deploy it like any other `Unfurl` project.


You have two options for setting up your Unfurl home:

A) Do nothing and use your system's current environment
-------------------------------------------------------

By default, the first time you create an Unfurl project it will automatically generate a home project if it is missing. The default configuration will look for standard environment variables
such as ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``.
Individual unfurl projects can filter or set the variables in its environment
through the `environment` subsection of the `context` in the project file.

B) Explicitly create and edit your home project
-----------------------------------------------

Before you create your first Unfurl project, run `unfurl home --init` to create the home project.
It will be placed in `~/.unfurl_home` unless you specify otherwise using the `--home` option.

Now you can customize the project and , for example:

1. Edit the default context and create new contexts in ``unfurl.yaml``

2. Add secrets or configure secret manager

3. Edit the connections in `~/.unfurl_home/ensemble.yaml`.
Add additional connections or change them
from using environment variables to using secrets stored in a secret manager (see `secrets`)
or just hard code the settings.

4. Bootstrap dev tools

5. Deploy local instances, like supervisord

6. Declare shared and default resources. For example, if several project will use a pre-existing Kubernetes cluster, you could add an template that models it here. You can use the `default directive` to indicate that template should only be used if it wasn't already declared in the main project.

`~/.unfurl_home/ensemble.yaml` contains a template (`asdfBootstrap`) that will install
local versions of the tools Unfurl's `configurators` need (eg. asdf, Terraform, gcloud, and Helm)
It install these tools, run `unfurl deploy ~/.unfurl_home`.

.. tip::
   Don't worry about making mistakes -- as a regular Unfurl project, your `.unfurl_home`
   contains a git repository so you can rollback to previous versions of your config files.


2. Create a project
===================

Now you are ready to create your first Unfurl project.

Run `unfurl init`

This will create a new project and commit it to new git repository unless the
``--existing`` flag is used. If specified, Unfurl will search the current directory and its parents looking for the nearest existing git repository. It will then add the new project to that repository if one is found.

`unfurl init` will also create an ensemble in the project unless the ``--empty`` flag used.
By default, a separate, local git repository will be created for the ensemble. Use the `--mono` flag to add the ensemble to the project's git repository or use the `--submodule` flag to add the ensemble's git repository as a submodule of the project's git repository.

Keeping the ensemble repository separate from the project repository is useful
if the resources the ensemble creates are transitory or if you want to restrict access to them.
Using the `--submodule` option allows those repositories to be easily packaged and shared with the project repository
but still maintain separate access control and git history for each ensemble.

Once created, the project directory will look like:

| ├── .git
| │   └── info/exclude
| │   └── ... (other git stuff)
| ├── .gitignore
| ├── .gitattributes
| ├── unfurl.yaml
| ├── ensemble-template.yaml
| ├── local
| │   └── unfurl.yaml
| ├── ensemble
| │   └── public
| │   └── ensemble.yaml

In the folder structure above:

- ``unfurl.yaml`` is the Unfurl project configuration file.
- Any files in``local`` is excluded from the git repository
- ``local/unfurl.yaml`` is included by the parent ``unfurl.yaml``
  and is where you'll put local or private settings you don't want to commit.
- ``ensemble-template.yaml`` is a template that is shared across ensembles in this project.
  You'll probably want to put your ensemble's ``service template`` here.
- ``ensemble`` is the folder that contains the default ensemble
  (use the ``--empty`` flag to skip creating this).
- ``ensemble/ensemble.yaml`` is the manifest file for this ensemble.
    It includes ``ensemble-template.yaml``.
- Private repository folders (like ``ensemble``) are listed in ``.git/info/exclude``

3. Create a service template
============================

If you look at `ensemble_template.yaml`, you'll see that it contains a minimal template with one node template and one workflow.
Workflows are optional but defining one is the simplest way to get started,
because you just need to declare procedural steps instead of designing model of your topology.

Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) is an OASIS standard language to describe a topology of cloud based web services,
their components, relationships, and the processes that manage them.
The TOSCA standard includes specifications to describe processes that create or modify web services. You can read more about it on the OASIS website.

You can find examples

https://github.com/oasis-open/tosca-community-contributions/tree/master/examples/1.3/tutorial

.. code-block:: YAML

  topology_template:
    node_templates:
      my_server:
        type: tosca.nodes.Compute
        capabilities:
          # Host container properties
          host:
            properties:
              num_cpus: 1
              disk_size: 200GB
              mem_size: 512MB
          # Guest Operating System properties
          os:
            properties:
              # host Operating System image properties
              architecture: x86_64
              type: linux
              distribution: ubuntu
              version: focal

A couple of things to note:
* ``tosca.nodes.Compute`` on the these
* In tosca dependencies

  D. build-in types
  E. dependencies

4. Implementing an operation
============================

Of course, we don't have enough information "my_server" to actually create a compute instance -- it could be, for example, a physical machine, a virtual machine, a docker image or Kubernetes pod.
"my_server" are a set of abstract constraints that be applied to any number of

It is the implementation that create (or discover) instances that conforms to this specification.
Implementations are defined by specifying how to carry ouy operations that are applied to the node templates.
TOSCA defines a vocabulary of a few standard operations such as "create" or "delete" and you can define your own.
Their implementations can be a simple as the name of a shell script to invoke or yaml specification that is passed to a `configurator`,
which is Unfurl's plugin system for implementing operations.
Unfurl ships with several configurators, including ones for Ansible, Terraform and Kubernetes.

We can implement ``my_server`` in just few lines of YAML by Google Cloud Platform by calling the `gcloud` tool.
We'll start with "delete" to make the

.. code-block:: YAML

  topology_template:
    node_templates:
      my_server:
        type: tosca.nodes.Compute
        # details omitted, see example above
      interfaces:
        Standard:
          delete:
            implementation: gcloud compute instances delete {{ '.name' | eval }}
        # ... see example below for more operations

Creates a little more verbose and illustrates how to pass input parameters and set attributes on the instance created from a template:

.. code-block:: YAML

  topology_template:
    node_templates:
      my_server:
        type: tosca.nodes.Compute
        # details omitted, see example above
      interfaces:
        Standard:
          delete:
            implementation: gcloud compute instances delete {{ '.name' | eval }}
          create:
            implementation: |
              gcloud compute instances create {{ '.name' | eval }}
                --boot-disk-size={{ {"get_property": ["SELF", "host", "disk_size"]} | eval | regex_replace(" ") }}
                --image=$(gcloud compute images list --filter=name:{{ {'get_property': ['SELF', 'os', 'distribution']} | eval }}
                      --filter=name:focal --limit=1 --uri)
                --machine-type=e2-medium   > /dev/null
              && gcloud compute instances describe {{ '.name' | eval }} --format=json
            inputs:
              resultTemplate:
                # recursively merge the map with the yaml anchor "gcloudStatusMap"
                +*gcloudStatusMap:
                eval:
                  then:
                    attributes:
                      public_ip: "{{ result.networkInterfaces[0].accessConfigs[0].natIP }}"
                      private_ip: "{{ result.networkInterfaces[0].networkIP }}"
                      zone: "{{ result.zone | basename }}"
                      id:  "{{ result.selfLink }}"
            # ...  see below

This implementation calls ``gcloud compute instances create`` to create the instance
and then ``gcloud compute instances describe``. The ``resultTemplate`` parses that json and

One mysterious looking line is ``+*gcloudStatusMap:`` which is a merge directive
That's because its an anchor to a yaml map we haven't defined yet.
We'll see it when we finish off the implementation by defining the "check" operation:

.. code-block:: YAML

  topology_template:
    node_templates:
      my_server:
        type: tosca.nodes.Compute
        # details omitted...
      interfaces:
        # other operations omitted, see example above
        Install:
          check:
            implementation: gcloud compute instances describe {{ '.name' | eval }}  --format=json
            inputs:
              resultTemplate: &gcloudStatusMap
                eval:
                  if: $result
                  then:
                    readyState:
                      state: "{{ {'PROVISIONING': 'creating', 'STAGING': 'starting',
                                'RUNNING': 'started', 'REPAIRING' 'error,'
                                'SUSPENDING': 'stopping',  'SUSPENDED': 'stopped',
                                'STOPPING': 'deleting', 'TERMINATED': 'deleted'}[result.status] }}"
                      local: "{{ {'PROVISIONING': 'pending', 'STAGING': 'pending',
                                'RUNNING': 'ok', 'REPAIRING' 'error,'
                                'SUSPENDING': 'error',  'SUSPENDED': 'error',
                                'STOPPING': 'absent', 'TERMINATED': 'absent'}[result.status] }}"
                vars:
                  result: "{%if success %}{{ stdout | from_json }}{% endif %}"

The "check" operation is part of the ``Install`` interface, an Unfurl specific TOSCA extention.
It defines a "check" operation for checking the status of an existing interface; a "discover" operation for discovering pre-existing instances
and a "revert" operation for reverting changes made by Unfurl on a pre-existing resource.

The ``resultTemplate`` (shared with ``create``) maps Google Compute ["status" enumeration](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/instance-life-cycle) to TOSCA's node state and to Unfurl's operation status.
We can see that it uses TOSCA's functions with Ansible's Jinja2 expressions and filters, glued together using Unfurl's expression syntax (``eval``)

4 Activate your ensemble
========================

1. Run deploy
2. Commit your changes

5. Publish your project
=======================

You can publish and share your projects like any git repository.
If you want to publish local git repositories on a git hosting service like github.com
(e.g. ones created by ``unfurl init`` or ``unfurl clone``) follow these steps:

1. Create corresponding empty remote git repositories.
2. Set the new repositories as the remote origins for your local repositories
   with this command:

   ``git remote set-url origin <remote-url>``

   Or, if the repository is a git submodule set the URL use:

   ``git submodule set-url <path> <remote-url>``

3. Commit any needed changes in the repositories.
4. Running ``unfurl git push`` will push all the repositories in the project.
