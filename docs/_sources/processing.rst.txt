YAML Merge directives
=====================

When a YAML configuration is loaded, will look for dictionary keys that match the following pattern:

``'+'['?']['include'][*anchor][relative path][absolute path]``

and treat them as merge directives that update the dictionary by processing the directive and merging in its resolved value.

Merge directives can have the following components:

.. productionlist::
     merge key      : "+"["?"]["include"][anchor][relative_path][absolute_path]
     anchor         : "*"[PCHAR]*[PCHAR except "."]
     relative_path  : "."+
     absolute_path  : ["/" PCHAR*]+
     PCHAR           : any printable character except "/"


Each of these components are optional but at least one needs to be present, otherwise the key is ignored and included in the final document.

A leading '?' indicates that reference maybe missing, otherwise the processing will abort with an error.

``include`` indicates that value of the merge key includes a yaml or json file to load.

``*anchor``: a reference to YAML anchor that appears in either the current document or, a file was specified, from that file.

``relative path``: '.'+ The path starting at current location this key appears in.

``absolute path``: [/path]+ A path that is resolved following <jsonpointer> RFC

If the value of the merge directive is empty, merge the result using algorithm described below.
If the directive contains "include" and the value is a string, treat the value as a file path or a URL to a YAML or JSON file.
If the value is "raw", include the result without any further processing.

The resolved value is merged into the directive's dictionary using the following rules\:

  If the result of the lookup is not a JSON object or YAML map\:

    If the map containing the merge key has no other keys\:
      it will replaced by the result, otherwise abort processing with a merge error

    If the map being replaced appears as an item in a list and the result of the merge is also a list\:
      the list is spliced in place.

    (If you don't want that behavior just wrap the include in another list, e.g "[{+/list1: null}]")

    Otherwise, recursively merge the maps\:
      for each key in the result object
        if the key doesn't exist in the target\:
          add the key and value
        if value of the target key is not an object\:
          ignore this key

        otherwise, merge two values following these rules.


Restoring merge directives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When saving YAML config file that contained merge directive will attempt restore them even if the configuration has changed -- if the target object has changed, a new diff will be generated to reflect those changes.

Ansible Jinja2 Templates
========================

Filters
-------

  :eval: Evaluates the given `expression <eval expressions>` or function
  :mapValue: Resolves any `eval expressions` or template strings in the give map or list.
  :abspath: see `abspath`,
  :get_dir: see `get_dir`
  :which: Returns the full path to the given executable, like the ``which`` shell command.

Lookup plugins
--------------

  :unfurl: Evaluates the given `expression <eval expressions>`
           For example: ``{{ lookup("unfurl", "::instance1::anAttribute") }}``
