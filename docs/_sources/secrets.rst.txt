Managing Secrets
================

Unfurl allows you to store secrets separately from the rest for your configuration, either in separate configuration file or in a secrets manager such as HashiCorp Vault. In the project configuration file you specify how those secrets should be managed. You can apply the following strategies:

* Store the secrets in a local configuration file and distribute that file out-of-band if necessary.
* Encrypt the secrets file using `Ansible Vault <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html>`_ so they can be safely checked into the ensemble repository.
* Store them in a secrets manager such as HashiCorp Vault or Amazon Secrets Manager or your OS's keyring. You can use any secrets manager that has an `Ansible Lookup Plugin <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/lookup.html>`_ available for it.
* If your ensemble repository is private and the secrets not highly sensitive you can just commit it into the repository in plain text.

You can apply any of these techniques to different secrets and projects can inherit the secrets configuration from `unfurl_home`.

      # if secret isn't defined above look it up in a HashiCorp Vault instance
      # (assumes VAULT_TOKEN etc. environment variables are set)
      default: "{{ lookup('hashi_vault', 'secret='+key) }}" # "key" will be set to the secret name

The "unfurl-vault-client" script outputs the vault password for the current project
 so you can encrypt secrets using the "ansible-vault" utility like this:
 ansible-vault encrypt_string --vault-id default@unfurl-vault-client "secret1" "secret2"

Sensitive Values
----------------
You can mark configuration data as sensitive. If you have Ansible Vault ids associated with your ensemble that will be saved encrypted, if not, they will be saved as "<<<Redacted>>>". When loading a YAML configuration file, any Vault data will be decrypted and any attribute with a value of "<<<Redacted>>>" will be omitted. By default, "unfurl init" will generate a random Ansible Vault key to your local secrets (found in "local/unfurl.yaml") and so any data marked sensitive will be encrypted.

Creating secrets
